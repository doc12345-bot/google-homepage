This is my first attempt at creating a webpage - I will try to imitate Googles homepage. Simple, but it's my first project so relax!

Today; I experimented with forms in HTML - I added text boxes, radio buttons, checkboxes, submit buttons and generic buttons.
I also tried using and external CSS style - linking to it within the HTML file. The page still looks shit but its still fun.

Next: Try Internal and Inline CSS.
