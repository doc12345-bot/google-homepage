This is my first attempt at creating a webpage - I will try to imitate Googles homepage. Simple, but it's my first project so relax!

Today; I experimented with forms in HTML - I added text boxes, radio buttons, checkboxes, submit buttons and generic buttons.
I also tried using and external CSS style - linking to it within the HTML file. The page still looks shit but its still fun.

Update; Turns out I was using both of the other types of CSS already in this page, I'm just stupid.
I tried aligning an element in the center and also aligned text in the center. I've done some testing and playing with all of this now and I'm going to try and accurately recreated the google homepage. Wish me luck!
So - I've been able to get things in nearly the right place - the google log, the search bar and both buttons. But there's still a lot of overlap and problems. I have also tried to add the nav bar at the top, this is not as successful. Overall I feel like I did a lot, though.

July 18th - Realigned the navigation bar at the top and split the buttons into two groups. Then added another bar along the bottom. I still can't get the search bar to go to the right place or the google logo and the buttons. Maybe next time!

Jul 19th - General tidying and cleaning plus I tried to sort out the placement of items on the page. Still struggling but will try again next time.

July20th - Fixed the bottom navbar! I also tidied up some part of the page. Using border-radius, I was able to add rounded corners to the search buttons and also changed the display when a user hover's over them. I tried again to fix the positioning but not everything is bunched together! Back to the drawing board. Oh and I sorted the sign in button!

July 21st - Finally solved the position problem! In the style sheet I added a margin top to main and it bumped everything down and into the right place. I also hade to amend the position of the buttons and the bar, which still aren't right. I also stylized the the search bar a little but can't quite get it right. Almost there!

July 26th - Finally fixed the search bar so it looks somewhat accurate. It's definitely not perfect but it looks a little bit like the real thing, which feels good. I think this is as far as I want to take this. There are still potentially lots of things I could do, if I get any feedback about it I'll go back and change it. Time to upload!
